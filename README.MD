# Overview

This repo is example how to self-host analytics.js. We built analytics.js from https://github.com/fivetran/analytics.js, which is a very slight fork of https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js, and are hosting it at https://static.fivetran.com/scripts/analytics.js.

# Running locally with NPM

To run demo, go the `./demo/<demo name>` folder, then run the following commands: 
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
